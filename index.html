            <h2>Hi I'm Jaden</h2>
            <p><strong><i>Pursuit of happiness </i></strong>is lifelong goal of myself. </p>

            <p>Searching for the job best fits my life and I am good at has been journey that I took to find 
            my happiness and satisfaction. Not a single job or position was bad nor dissatisfied, yet it was 
            another day of journey I enjoyed and learned new things. </p>

            <p> Starting from event management, I have experienced and executed mass event handling for small to 
            larger scale concerts and events. Daily challenges to complete tasks and manage artists and other team members. </p>

            <p>Journey moved on to marketing, where I have built my career for traditional, digital, 
            and experiential marketing as I worked with numerous clients in varying fields. 
            This got me into interest in future of e-commerce and power of digital marketing 
            that I can implement for brand I can dedicate myself to. </p>

            <p>So, I moved on to e-commerce field to experience and create another milestone of my lifelong journey. 
            As I join and working with number of e-commerce company, I have executed regular planning, design, 
            and execution of all digital media Ads. Also, with current job I have built number of Shopify website. 
            Through this process I have seen so much potential of e-commerce, however I have also seen limitation 
            from using template-based e-commerce stores in terms of function and overall frameworks. 
            Then I began carving another milestone for the future and open more doors for my future and move 
            forward to my goal of finding “perfect career”. Now I am in 4th month of learning full-stack 
            coding where I am learning overall scheme of “Coding.” </p> 

            <p>HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, Python, Ruby, express….. new terms, 
            new language, and new way of viewing the world. I am happy that I have started this journey and 
            hoping to find so where I can utilize this newly learning skills!</p>

            <p>Well.. I am happy right now, however I am available and open to new world !</p>
